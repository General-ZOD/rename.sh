rename.sh
=========

Bash script to provide the rename functionality in any flavor of Linux.
Since Bash does not naturally come with a rename functionality, this bash script adds that functionality.
To use, 
 * copy the "rename.sh" to the home folder (or any folder really)
 * run the command ./rename.sh -option old_file new_file (or "rename.sh -option old_file new_file" if the path is already in the PATH environment variable)
 * available options are f (or individual files) and d (directories)
 * old_file is any file or directory to be renamed
 * new_file is the new name for the file or directory



**Script is provided without any warranty or guarantee. Use at your own risk.
